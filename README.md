GitHub action to deploy [StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/) to an AWS VM (EC2) with [Terraform](operations/deployment/terraform/modules) and [Ansible](https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2).

## Prerequisites
- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) and [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)
- The following secrets should be added to your GitHub actions secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `ST2_AUTH_USERNAME`
  - `ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD`


## Example usage

Create a Github Action Workflow `.github/workflow/deploy-st2.yaml` with the following to build on push to the `main` branch.

```yaml
# Deploy ST2 Single VM with GHA
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy-st2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - id: deploy-st2
      name: Deploy StackStorm
      # NOTE: we recommend pinning to the latest numeric version
      # See: https://github.com/bitovi/github-actions-deploy-stackstorm/releases
      uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-stackstorm@main
      with:
        aws_default_region: us-east-1
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
        st2_auth_username: ${{ secrets.ST2_AUTH_USERNAME}}
        st2_auth_password: ${{ secrets.ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD}}
```

This will create the following resources in AWS:
- An EC2 instance
- Route53 records
- A load balancer
- Security groups (ports `80`, `443`, `22`)
- Optionally, a VPC with subnets (see `aws_create_vpc`)

> For more details about what is created, see [operations/deployment/terraform/modules](operations/deployment/terraform/modules/)

## Customizing

### Inputs

The following inputs can be used as `steps.with` keys:

| Name             | Type    | Default     | Description                        |
|------------------|---------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `checkout` | bool | `true` | Specifies if this action should checkout the code (i.e. whether or not to run the `uses: actions/checkout@v3` action prior to deploying so that the deployment has access to the repo files) |
| **AWS configuration** |
| `aws_access_key_id` | string | | AWS access key ID (Required) |
| `aws_secret_access_key` | string | | AWS secret access key (Required) |
| `aws_session_token` | string | | AWS session token |
| `aws_default_region` | string | `us-east-1` | AWS default region (Required) |
| `ec2_instance_type` | string | `t2.medium` | The AWS EC2 instance type. |
| `ec2_instance_profile` | string | | [The AWS IAM instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) to use for the EC2 instance. Use if you want to pass an AWS role with specific permissions granted to the instance |
| `aws_resource_identifier` | string | `${org}-{repo}-{branch}` | Auto-generated by default so it's unique for org/repo/branch. Set to override with custom naming the unique AWS resource identifier for the deployment. |
| `aws_create_vpc` | bool | `false` | Whether an AWS VPC should be created in the action. Otherwise, the existing default VPC will be used. |
| `infrastructure_only` | bool | `false` | Does infrastructure (i.e. terraform) but **not** the deployment (i.e. ansible) |
| **Teraform configuration** |
| `tf_state_bucket` | string | `${org}-${repo}-{branch}-tf-state` | AWS S3 bucket to use for Terraform state. By default, a new deployment will be created for each unique branch. Hardcode if you want to keep a shared resource state between the several branches. |
| **StackStorm configuration** |
| `st2_auth_username` | string | | Username used by StackStorm standalone authentication. Set as a secret in GH Actions. |
| `st2_auth_password` | string | | Password used by StackStorm standalone authentication. Set as a secret in GH Actions. |
| `st2_packs` | string |`"st2"` | Comma separated list of packs to install. If you modify this option, be sure to also include `st2` in the list. |
| `st2_ansible_extra_vars_file` | string | | Relative path from project root to Ansible vars file. If you'd like to adjust more advanced configuration; st2 version, st2.conf, RBAC, chatops, auth, etc. See https://github.com/stackStorm/ansible-st2#variables for the full list of settings. The Ansible vars will take higher precedence over the GHA inputs. |
| **Cleanup** |
| `stack_destroy` | bool | `false` | Set to `true` to Destroy the created AWS infrastructure for this instance |
| `tf_state_bucket_destroy` | bool | `false` | Force purge and deletion of `tf_state_bucket` defined. Any file contained there will be destroyed. `stack_destroy` must also be `true`. Use if you want to clean up the resources |


## Note about AWS resource identifiers
Most resources will contain the tag `GITHUB_ORG-GITHUB_REPO-GITHUB_BRANCH` to make them unique. Because some AWS resources have a length limit, we shorten identifiers to a `60` characters max string.

We use the Kubernetes style for this. For example, `Kubernetes` -> `k(# of characters)s` -> `k8s`. And so you might see how compressions are made.

For some specific resources, we have a `32` characters limit. If the identifier length exceeds this number after compression, we remove the middle part and replace it with a hash made up of the string itself.

### S3 buckets naming
Bucket names can be made of up to 63 characters. If the length allows us to add `-tf-state`, we will do so. If not, a simple `-tf` will be added.

## Made with BitOps
[BitOps](https://bitops.sh/) allows you to define Infrastructure-as-Code for multiple tools in a central place. This action uses BitOps Docker container with prebuilt deployment tools and [Operations Repository Structure](https://bitops.sh/operations-repo-structure/) to organize the necessary Terraform and Ansible steps, create infrastructure and deploy to it.

### Extra BitOps Configuration
You can pass additional `BITOPS_` ENV variables to adjust the deployment behavior.
```yaml
- name: Deploy StackStorm to AWS (dry-run)
  uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-stackstorm@main
  env:
    # Extra BitOps configuration:
    BITOPS_LOGGING_LEVEL: DEBUG
    # Extra Terraform configuration:
    # https://bitops.sh/tool-configuration/configuration-terraform/#terraform-bitops-schema
    BITOPS_TERRAFORM_COMMAND: plan
    # Extra Ansible configuration:
    # https://bitops.sh/tool-configuration/configuration-ansible/#cli-configuration
    BITOPS_ANSIBLE_DRYRUN: true
  with:
    aws_default_region: us-east-1
    aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    st2_auth_username: ${{ secrets.ST2_AUTH_USERNAME }}
    st2_auth_password: ${{ secrets.ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD}}
```
In this example, we instruct BitOps to run a `terraform plan` instead of `terraform apply` and to run Ansible in `--check` mode, additionally, we set the BitOps container logging level to `DEBUG`.

## Future
In the future, this action may support more cloud providers (via [BitOps Plugins](https://bitops.sh/plugins/) like [AWS](https://github.com/bitops-plugins/aws)) such as:
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/)
- [Open Stack](https://www.openstack.org/)
- [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/)
- etc

This action may also support multiple deployment types such as:
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/StackStorm/stackstorm-k8s)
- Multi-VM

This action is still in its early stages, so we welcome your feedback! [Open an issue](issues/) if you have a feature request.
